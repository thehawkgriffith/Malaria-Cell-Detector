I have used the Keras, ImageDataGenerator to feed
the images into my pipeline, since the dataset was quite large,
I figured it was the only viable option.


The data is very sparse, thus the model struggles to learn 
optimum features, further improvements in line.
Perhaps a little preprocessing of the images can yiekd better results.
